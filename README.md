# Calculator

Calculator project for The Odin Project: Foundations

## Specifications

This calculator contains functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Gotchas:

Watch out for and fix these bugs if they show up in your code:

- You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the display.

- Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!

### Extra credit

- Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though, like: 12.3.56.5. Disable the . button if there’s already a decimal separator in the display.

- Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo their last input if they click the wrong number.

- Add keyboard support!
